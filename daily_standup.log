# Daily Log Template

For each entry of the log you should answer the following three questions:

* What I did yesterday?
* What I'm doing today, that is helping the product be better?
* Is something stopping me to achieve my goal today?

Make sure you include the date. Here is an example:

## 2022-03-29

* What I did yesterday?
  - Nothing, first day today.
* What I'm doing today, that is helping the product be better?
  - Setup repo
  - Setup dashboard
  - Add tickets to the dashboard
* Is something stopping me to achieve my goal today?
  - Super busy with my current job
